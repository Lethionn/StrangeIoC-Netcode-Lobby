# **StrangeIoC Netcode Lobby**

This is the lobby system used in the multiplayer game project *Slay the Party*. It is built using Unity's **Netcode for GameObjects** and **Lobby** packages, integrated with the **StrangeIoC framework**. The system utilizes a host-client model, enabling players to create or join lobbies for gameplay. *(Note: The game itself is not included.)*
